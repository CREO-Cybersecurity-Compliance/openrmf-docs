Congratulations on installing the OpenRMF tool! Please make sure the secrets you referenced 
in the values.yaml file are correct and setup in the correct namespace 'openrmfdev'. 

To verify that OpenRMF has started, run:

  kubectl --namespace=openrmfdev get deployments -l "release=testnumber2"

You can now point your web browser to http://openrmf.local/web/ to run the OpenRMF tool 
within your cluster! Make sure your Keycloak (or OpenID) authentication is ready to go.
