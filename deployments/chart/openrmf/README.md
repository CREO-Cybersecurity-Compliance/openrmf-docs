# Using Helm and Tiller to deploy OpenRMF into kubernetes (k8s)

If you have helm and tiller setup you can use the helm command with the charts and values supplied
to setup the OpenRMF demo within k8s. The values.yaml file has the DNS name of what you want the 
main URL to be to use the demo via HTTP. For now that is the only real value needed. 

To install Helm into your cluster see https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/.

## Steps to install the OpenRMF Demo

1. Run `kubectl apply -f ./deployments/kubernetes/namespace.yaml`from the root folder within the repo. This makes the namespace to run all the pieces in.
1. Run `kubectl apply -f ./deployments/kubernetes/pv.yaml`from the root folder within the repo. This makes the persistent volume to use. Adjust as necessary. Run this only if you need a new PV to use.
3. Run `helm install ./deployments/chart/openrmf`from the root folder within the repo.
4. Verify by going to the HTTP path shown after a successful helm install to verify it is working.

## Values.yaml for your MUX AEW install

The values.yaml file has only 4 fields to configure. The defaults match up to the Keycloak documentation however you can make these whatever you want them to be. 

### main DNS name used to access the deployed app in k8s via DNS through an ingress controller
```
dnsName: openrmf.local
```
It is the DNS name that you want the ingress to respond to. This can be a DNS pointer to the IP of your k8s installation. It also could be the `minikube ip` for a local  install setup in your /etc/hosts file. Whichever it is, make the name match DNS so your deployment can be accessed via a web browser.

### The Identity Provider URL and Realm, i.e. using Keycloak for AuthN and AuthZ
```
IdentityProviderURL: http://192.168.11.22:9001/auth
```
This is the root URL of Keycloak or whatever you want to try and use as the Identity Provider.

### The Realm to use from the ID provider
```
IdentityProviderRealm: openrmf
```
This is the Realm name of the Identity Provider.

### The Identity Provider Client Id to use
```
IdentityProviderClientId: openrmf
```
This is the Client Id within the realm you made for the Identity Provider.
