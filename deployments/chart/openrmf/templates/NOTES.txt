Congratulations on installing the OpenRMF tool! Please make sure the secrets you referenced 
in the values.yaml file are correct and setup in the correct namespace '{{.Values.namespace}}'. 

To verify that OpenRMF has started, run:

  kubectl --namespace={{.Values.namespace}} get deployments -l "release={{ .Release.Name }}"

You can now point your web browser to http://{{.Values.dnsName}}/web/ to run the OpenRMF tool 
within your cluster! Make sure your Keycloak (or OpenID) authentication is ready to go.
