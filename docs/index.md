# OpenRMF Introduction

Welcome to the OpenRMF Docs site. This site contains help screens, scenarios, screenshots and 
other useful information to use the OpenRMF tool fo you and your team. 

OpenRMF is the only open source tool to manage your DoD STIG checklists, generate NIST compliance, keep track of your security items that are Open or Not Reviewed, and shrink your timeline to submit for an ATO!

See [What's New](./whatsnew.md) with the latest version 0.9.

## What it does
OpenRMF removes the Information Assurance mystery! It allows management to view the status of checklists and RMF progress on their systems. It allows IT administrators and developers to store their checklists in a single place. It allows cybersecurity analysts to see the status of systems in a quick glance. And it allows assessors to have a single place to view the system and all its checklists so their job is more organized. It has a great use for everyone.

Some of the high level features are below:

* 100% web based
* 100% Open Source Software (OSS)
* Upload a CKL or SCAP XCCDF format file easily to visualize your RMF process
* Automatically organizes your checklists by system
* Single source of truth for your system checklists
* Management insight into Cybersecurity Status and Security Posture instantly
* AuthN, AuthZ, and Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to control access to read as well as edit data
* Run on premise, on a local machine, or in the cloud
* Easily find errors and deltas across checklists in your system
* Easily run a compliance report in seconds for your Low, Moderate, or High system

## Why use OpenRMF
The current way to implement the Risk Management Framework for your DoD Authority to Operate is very slow. It is driven by disparate pieces of a Java Viewer for checklists, MS Excel for viewing the checklists for management, MS Word documents, various PDF files, and more. Information is shared via email and shared folders. And there is no one central place for developers, operations, management, and cybersecurity analysts to see the most up to date information. 

OpenRMF aims to solve this dilemma. All you need is a web browser to view the pertinent information on your checklists within your system. Checklists are grouped by system and quickly show information such as the number of Category 1, 2, and 3 items as well as the number of Open items versus the Not a Finding "closed" items. Without having to open every single checklist file in the heavy Java viewer DISA provides. 

OpenRMF helps in a few ways:
* It is 100% browser based for all the major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, IE 11)
* You can import multiple checklists for a single source-of-truth for all checklists
* Reports for management highlight the most asked question on status and numbers of items by type
* You can run a single compliance report across all your checklists based on the Low/Moderate/High label as well as PII data included
* You can export any checklists to Excel or download a CKL file for viewing in the DISA Java Viewer

With coming updates such as automating the Risk Assessment Report, automating the POA&M on fixes, as well as online editing of checklist status and comments OpenRMF is the app any DoD IT / Developer / Operations / Cybersecurity professional needs!
