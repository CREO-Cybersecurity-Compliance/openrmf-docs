# Viewing your Systems and Checklists

![OpenRMF System List](/assets/system-listing.png)

The System listing is available when you log in and click on Checklists in the menu. The above screen loads if there are any checklists loaded. FOr now, this is a fairly simple page with the System Name and number of checklists. Improvements on this page will be made in future releases.

Note: if no checklists are loaded then you are automatically redirected to the Upload page.

On the Systems listing page click the button next to the system with the checklists and you will be taken to a table listing all checklists. The initial page shows 50 at a time and has pagination at the bottom right of the screen. There is also a filter you can type into and automatically filter the listing of checklists for that system. 

Each row of the listing shows the total count of items per checklist by status of Not a Finding, Not Applicable, Open, and Not Reviewed. Click the green plus sign to the left and that total number is broken down by item category. The last update date is also listed. Click the linked title to view the detailed record of the checklist.
