# Checklist Detailed View

![OpenRMF Checklist Details](/assets/checklist-record.png)

The detailed Checklist page shows several things about the checklist. It shows the title, automatically named by the checklist uploaded. The format is "hostname"-"type of checklist"-"release and date of the checklist format". So a Windows 10 STIG from the Release 19 Oct 25 2019 of the STIG of the machine named "myserver" would be "MYSERVER-WIN 10 STIG-R19 dated 25 Oct 2019". 

The scoring of the checklist based on status is one of the first things you see as well. The total and then breakdown by category is shown with the relevant colors. There are also download links for the CKL file, an Excel version of the checklist to download, as well as a Delete button. These buttons depend on the Download role and Editor role respectively. Or if you have the Administrator role you get them all.

The specific STIG title and asset information from the STIG checklist are shown next. Then the main section of the checklist is shown. On the left of the section is a list of every single vulnerability for this checklist, color coded by status. Click the vulnerability and the details of it show on the right.  You also can filter the vulnerabilities by status by checking / unchecking the 4 statuses to filter the list down accordingly.

At the bottom of this page are quick visual graph representations of the status and category breakdown of the checklist as well.
