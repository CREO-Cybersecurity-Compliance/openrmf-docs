# Your OpenRMF Dashboard

![OpenRMF Dashboard](/assets/dashboard.png)

The initial OpenRMF dashboard currently lists key information at the top of the page. It shows the total number of checklists loaded, any alerts, the number of users, and the current version number. Currently the alerts and users are static and are placeholders for future functionality. 

The other information on this page shows the last 5 checklists by activity. The list has a table showing the linked checklist titles. Click the title to go to the detailed checklist page for that record. It also shows the number of items per checklist based on the status. Click the green arrow to expand and show the number of items per status per category. 

Future enhancements will allow setting of items on the dashboard to your liking as well as show alerts, status, dates, and valid user information.
